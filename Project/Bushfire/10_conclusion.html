								Conclusion

<h3 style="float: left;">(1) Development trend of bushfire</h3><img src="images/9.jpg" ><br />
• In <b>September</b>, the bushfires mainly occurred in QLD and NSW. The situation was under control and the bushfire spots were going down during the month. <br />
• Then, in <b>October</b>, the overall bushfire situation in Australia remains stable.
• Unfortunately, the bushfire situation deteriorated sharply from <b>November</b>. Fire spots increased dramatically in NSW, nearly 10 to 20 times than previous times. <br />
• In <b>December</b>, bushfire spots in each state or territory remained at a high level, and the overall situation in QLD and WA went worse during that time. <br />
• In <b>January</b> of 2020, VIC became the state most affected by the bushfires. The highest number of bushfires points were recorded during that time. <br />
• Luckily, from the mid of January, the bushfire in Australia was gradually extinguished and the number of fire points decreased quickly.
<br /><br />
<h3 style="float: left;">(2) Weather conditions and the Bushfire</h3>
<img src="images/8.jpg"/>
• The <b>mean temperature</b> of each state or territory in November, December, and January was much higher than in other months. Correspondingly, bushfire situations were much worse in these months.<br />
• As for <b>wind</b>, the average wind speed in November and December was pretty high, which had a positive impact on the bushfire extension and the highest bushfire spots had been recorded during this time. <br />
•<b> MSLP</b> in SA is much higher than other states, and we would suppose that the high MSLP can curb the spread of the bushfire.
